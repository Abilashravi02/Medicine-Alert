# Medication Reminder System

## Project Summary

In today's world, the prevalence of diseases necessitates regular medication for many individuals. Diseases, both temporary and life-threatening, have become increasingly common, impacting human longevity and quality of life. To manage these conditions effectively, patients often require multiple medications prescribed by their doctors. However, remembering to take medications on time and adhering to prescribed schedules can be challenging, leading to health complications such as missed doses, incorrect medications, and accidental consumption of expired drugs.

Our project addresses these challenges by developing an Android-based smartphone application integrated with a real-time clock system. This application aims to simplify medication management by allowing users to input their prescription details, including medication names, dosage amounts, intake times, and duration of treatment. Once entered, the system notifies users through mobile alerts and physical reminders precisely when each medication dose is due.

### Key Features:

- **Personalized Prescription Management:** Users can input their medication schedules, ensuring they are reminded promptly at the designated times.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Mobile notifications and physical reminders ensure users never miss a dose.
- **Enhanced Medication Adherence:** Reduces the risk of missed doses and improves overall adherence to prescribed treatments.
- **Safety and Reliability:** Helps prevent medication errors such as overdosing and ensures users take only the prescribed medications at the right times.

### Implementation:

The application leverages the Android platform's capabilities, integrating with the device's real-time clock to deliver accurate reminders. Users interact with a user-friendly interface to set up their medication schedules, which are then stored and managed securely within the application.

### Future Enhancements:

Future updates may include integration with health monitoring devices, doctor-patient communication features, and data analytics to track adherence and health outcomes.

### How to Use:

1. **Install the Application:** Download and install the app onto your Android device.
2. **Set Up Your Medication Profile:** Enter details such as medication names, dosage, frequency, and duration.
3. **Receive Reminders:** Get notified via mobile alerts and physical reminders when it's time to take your medications.
